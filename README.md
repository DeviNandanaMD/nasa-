# üöÄ Solar Flare Storytellers: A Space Weather Guide

**Solution for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**

---

## Project Summary

Our project is an **interactive, digital storybook application** designed to educate youth and families about the profound and varied effects of space weather. We developed a multi-page web application using **Streamlit** (Python) featuring five characters‚Äîan Astronaut, Pilot, Farmer, Grid Operator, and Family‚Äîeach sharing a narrative about their unique experience with solar events.

This solution directly addresses the challenge **"Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings"** by fulfilling the requirement for a digital story focusing on diverse impacts. Our solution is important because space weather literacy is critical for the next generation, fostering awareness by demonstrating the human relevance of heliophysics and NASA science.

## üõ∞Ô∏è NASA Data and Challenge Relevance

The project's narrative and impact statements are grounded in specific scientific research and open data concepts, ensuring technical **Relevance** and **Validity**:

* **Solar Flares & CMEs:** The stories for the Astronaut and Pilot detail the immediate effects of solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).
* **GPS Disruption:** The Farmer's story is based on data showing how solar storms corrupt the accuracy of GPS signals used in precision agriculture.
* **Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs):** The Power Grid Operator's narrative demonstrates the threat of GICs to infrastructure, a key focus of space weather monitoring.
* **Auroral Dynamics:** The Family story uses the physics of solar particles interacting with Earth‚Äôs magnetic field to explain the visible aurora.
